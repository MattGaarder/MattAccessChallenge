Accessibility Challenge 17.11.2022

//Goal
This challenge was to give the Homiseon homepage the greatest accesbility functionality possible, by using semantic HTML elements to organise the page, and ensuring that all images are appropriately described using alt=. Comments were also added to describe the purpose of functions or changes in code. This will also make it easier for those who might use or want to change the code in the future.
